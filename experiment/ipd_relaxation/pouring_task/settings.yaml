  link_radius: 0.05 # by default
  # please select from noECA, ECA, ECA3, and ECAA
  # noECA: doesn't incorporate environment collision avoidance
  # ECA (by default): incorporates environment collision avoidance 
  # ECA3: incorporates environment collision avoidance, but only considers end-effector position goal matching, 
  #       and does not try to match the orientation of goals
  # ECAA: incorporates environment collision avoidance, adaptively adjusts the weight on the orientation 
  #       matching objectives on-the-fly, such that the importance of orientationmatching is reduced 
  #       when the robot is close to a collision state and raised to its standard value  
  #       when the robot is not close to a collision.
  objective_mode: ECAA 
  # please type keyboard here if interactive control is desired; if you want to have
  # the robot arm follow a cartesian path, put the animation file in the 
  # animation_files folder and type the file name here
  input_device: keyboard

# scale: usually a list of three float numbers, while a single float number is sufficient for spheres
# animation: there are three options available: static, interactive and [the name of an animation file]. 
#            The option "interactive" means that you will be able to drag the obstacle around with your mouse. 
#            If you want to drive the robot with an animation file, please make sure to put the corresponding 
#            animation file in the animation_files folder
